========

Traces aims to make it simple to:

-  read, write, and manipulate unevenly-spaced time series data
-  perform basic analyses of unevenly-spaced time series data without
   making an awkward / lossy transformation to evenly-spaced
   representations
-  gracefully transform unevenly-spaced times series data to
   evenly-spaced representations

This section has a few examples of how to do these things.
   
Basic analysis
--------------

TODO: This will have a simple distribution with start and end times, a
merge with several traces followed by a distribution, and finally a
stack and merge to create an average by week.

Read and write
--------------

TODO: This will show basic reading and writing, and how to use
compact, compress, and set domains.

Transform to evenly-spaced
--------------------------

TODO: This will show how to sample and send to numpy/pandas, or do a
moving average and send to numpy/pandas.
