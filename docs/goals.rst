Traces aims to make it simple to write *readable code* to:

- **Munge**. Read, write, and manipulate unevenly-spaced time series data
- **Explore**. Perform basic analyses of unevenly-spaced time series
  data without making an awkward / lossy transformation to
  evenly-spaced representations
- **GTFO**. Gracefully transform unevenly-spaced times series data to
  evenly-spaced representations
